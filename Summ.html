      <p class="description">
        Beowulf was a man who was born in Geatland, to Ecgtheow. He achieves numerous feats, and is told about a demon attacking Denmark. He goes to Denmark to attack the demon, whose name is Grendel. Once he kills Grendel, however, Grendel's mother comes to Denmark for revenge. Then, once Beowulf beats Grendel's mother and wipes out the bloodline, he returns to Geatland, and is crowned King of the Geats. After fifty years, however, an escaped servant steals a goblet from a dragon's hoard, causing the dragon to go berserk and burn every town he sees. So, Beowulf, despite being elderly, fights the dragon. The dragon is killed by Beowulf and a loyal thane, Wiglaf, but shortly after, Beowulf dies from his wounds.
