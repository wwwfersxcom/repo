      <h1 class="title">History of Anglo-Saxon Britain</h1>
      <p class="description">
        The Anglo-Saxon period spans the over six centuries from c.410-1066 CE. The Anglo-Saxon period was a time of religion and war, the breaking up of Roman Britannia into pieces and, after the 790s, battles against a new group, the Vikings. To start this period off, the Roman legions that had lived in Britain, from 46-410 CE, departed as the Roman Empire was in decline. After this, the relatively defenceless Romano-British were invaded by multiple groups, including the Angles, the Saxons, the Jutes and the Frisians. By 650 CE, there were seven kingdoms, Kent, Mercia, Northumbria, East Anglia, Essex, Sussex and Wessex. In 793, the Vikings raided Lindisfarne Monastery, forcing the kingdoms, now consolidated into three, to fight the Vikings, as allies. The three kingdoms were Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex. Then, in 886 CE, King Alfred the Great of Wessex and Guthrum of Denmark signed a treaty outlining the border between the Danelaw, or the region which the Vikings continued to rule, and Anglo-Saxon territory. Then, in 1066 CE, three kings from different places tried to gain control of the land: William of Normandy, Harald Hadrada of Norway and Harold Godwinson of England. Godwinson was able to repel Hadrada, but a suprise attack by the Norman forces led to William taking over, and the end of the Anglo-Saxon period.
